Solution provided for the last mile problem on the 3rd edition of HERE MapHack.
This android demo app displays the locations for the different load/unload points in Valencia, alongside with a batch of real but anonimyzed client locations, offering the user the possibility of toggle isochrones for both kind of points, in an effort of providing the logistic team a new layer of information when planning the delivery.
